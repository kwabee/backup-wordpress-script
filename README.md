A little script I made that enables you to backup your wordpress files and database

How to use it?

1. Log onto terminal.
2. Copy the script to the root of your website directory.
3. Edit the run-website-backup.sh
4. Make the neccessary changes to the directory and password etc.
5. execute the script by typing in "bash run-website-backup.sh"

Enjoy!
